        Here's a couple ways you can express yourself
        <ul>
            <li> If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here </li>
            <li> <italics> If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag </italics></li>
            <li> <bold> If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag </bold></li>
        </ul>
        You did it! You should be proud of yourself <br />
