        This exercise is about making lists
        <br />
        Here's what I like about lists:
        <br />
        <ul>
            <li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff </li>
            <li> That's about it</li>
            <li> I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        When you make a list, do it in this order:
        <br />
        <ol>
            <li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not </li>
            <li> If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag </li>
            <ul> 
                <li> Use li tags nested in the list for your list items </li>
                <ol>
                    <li> Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
            <li> You've got this, I believe in you! </li>
        </ol>
